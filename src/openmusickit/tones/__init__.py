"""
The `tones` module provides the foundational logic for pitch and interval operations.

It includes tools for transposing, inverting, and comparing tonal elements, as well as
the `TonalVector` classâ€”a core abstraction that encodes both pitches and intervals
as direction-aware vectors suitable for algorithmic and music-theoretical analysis.
