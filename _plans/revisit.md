# Revisit

A single running list of design questions that were noticed, discussed briefly,
and deliberately deferred. One `##` entry per item, newest last. When an item is
resolved, move its entry to the bottom under "Resolved" with a pointer to the
commit or plan that settled it.

## OmkId vs plain UUID strings (2026-09-18)

`OmkId` ([src/openmusickit/utils/id.py](../src/openmusickit/utils/id.py)) wraps a
UUID4 and compares equal to strings so that JSON persistence and graph backends
can use the string form as an atomic identifier. Question: is the wrapper class
earning its keep, or should ids simply be UUID strings? For now string equality
is kept and `__eq__` returns `NotImplemented` for anything other than `OmkId`
or `str`.

## Signed durations / edge displacement (2026-09-18, resolved 2026-09-19)

Durations are signed quantities. `Duration` requires `__neg__` and provides
`__sub__` as `self + (-other)`; `MetricalDuration` carries the sign on its
numerator, and opposite-sign sums resolve by length through `from_length`
(cancelling to `ZeroDuration`). `Next.displacement` is therefore a plain signed
`Duration`. A negative duration is never an event length: `SequentialEvent`
raises `ValueError` on any attempt to set one.

### TonalVector construction and interning (2026-09-18, resolved 2026-09-19)

Interning dropped. `TonalVector` is a plain tuple subclass with `__slots__ = ()`
(as are the `Tone` and `Interval` bases): no cache, no `__init__`, no
sentinel, no per-instance state; `pitch` and `interval` build their view
object on access. Reasons found in the walk-through: instances had a
`__dict__` and were not actually immutable; `copy.deepcopy` and `pickle` of
anything holding a `TonalVector` crashed; the cache ignored the class, so a
subclass could never be instantiated for a cached key. Everything compares by
`==` (`ModePattern` was the one `is`). Measured cost: ~80 bytes per
un-interned instance against ~540 for the `NoteEvent` holding it. A cache
behind `__new__` can be added later as a pure optimisation if a real score
ever shows the need; nothing would observe it.

### interval_quality string parser (2026-09-18, resolved 2026-09-19)

`IntervalQuality` is a frozen dataclass; the nineteen instances live in a
module table `QUALITIES` keyed by relative number, replacing the
`__new__`-interning and the `qualities` registry filled from `__init__`. The
string overload of `_get_quality` and `_get_quality_x` were dead (only their
own doctests called them) and are gone; `TonalVector.from_string` is the one
parser. `KeySignature` gained `__getnewargs__` so it too survives copy and
pickle.
